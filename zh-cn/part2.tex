\subsection{图象}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item 需要 \bftt{graphicx} 宏包提供
\cmdbs{includegraphics} 命令
\item 支持包括 JPEG, PNG 和 (大多数) PDF格式的图像.
\end{itemize}
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\includegraphics[
  width=0.5\textwidth]{gerbil}

\includegraphics[
  width=0.3\textwidth,
  angle=270]{gerbil}
\end{exampletwouptiny}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{插曲：非必需参数}
\begin{itemize}
\item 非必需参数都放在方括号 \keystrokebftt{[} \keystrokebftt{]} 里，而非花括号 \keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}}。
\item \cmdbs{includegraphics} 命令有许多参数可调整。这些非必需参数可以调整图像显示的方式。比如\bftt{width=0.3\cmdbs{textwidth}} 使图像宽度变为文段宽(\cmdbs{textwidth})乘以$0.3$。
\item \cmdbs{documentclass} 也有可选参数。比如：
\mint{latex}|\documentclass[12pt,twocolumn]{article}|
\vskip 3ex
将字体放大至12pt（小四）并用\bftt{twocolomn}分成两栏.
\item 去哪里查找这些可调整的参数？片末有资源。

\subsection[fragile]{图片位置/Floats}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \LaTeX{} 允许自定义图片位置 (“浮动”格式).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{制表}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \LaTeX{} 制表，习惯了其实很方便。
\item 用 \bftt{tabularx} 宏包的 \bftt{tabular}表格情境。 
\item 花括号里是各栏对齐方式——\textbf{l}eft左对齐, \textbf{r}ight右对齐, \textbf{r}ight右对齐.
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
物品   & 数量 & 单价 \$ \\
冬瓜   & 1   & 199.99  \\
南瓜   & 2   & 399.99  \\
西瓜   & 3   & 19.99   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item 这部分也能设置纵向分割线; \cmdbs{hline} 生成横向分割线。
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|} \hline
物品   & 数量 & 单价 \$ \\\hline
冬瓜   & 1   & 199.99  \\
南瓜   & 2   & 399.99  \\
西瓜   & 3   & 19.99   \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\item 用and符号 \keystrokebftt{\&} 分栏，双反斜线 \keystrokebftt{\bs}\keystrokebftt{\bs} 换行 (和第一部分 \bftt{align*} 情境中格式一样).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{bib\TeX}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item 把引用的论文信息用“bibtex”数据库格式放在一个 \bftt{.bib} 文档里：
\inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}{bib-example.bib}
\item 大多数引用处理器都能生成bibtex格式文件。
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \bftt{.bib} 文档中的每一项都有一个关键字 \emph{key} 可供在文内引用。如 \bftt{Jacobson1999Towards} 就是这篇论文的关键字：
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,frame=single]{latex}
@Article{Jacobson1999Towards,
  author = {Van Jacobson},
  ...
}
\end{minted}
\item 最好用作者/年份/标题作为关键字。
\item \LaTeX{} 可以自动对文内引用进行排版，并在文尾生成单独页面；它预存了常用的引用格式，也支持自定义。
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 3}
\begin{itemize}
\item 用 \bftt{natbib} 宏包\footnote{T还有一个功能更多的 \bftt{biblatex} 宏包。不过大多数文档还是用
  \bftt{natbib}。} 处理 \cmdbs{citet} 和 \cmdbs{citep}。
\item 在文尾插入 \cmdbs{bibliography} 命令并设置引用格式 \cmdbs{bibliographystyle}。
\end{itemize}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\linewidth}
\inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single,resetmargins]{latex}%
  {bib-example.tex}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.35\linewidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip,trim=1.8in 5in 1.8in 1in]{bib-example.pdf}
\end{minipage}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{练习}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{练习：组装文档}

为之前练习中的论文添加图片和引用部分。

\begin{enumerate}
\item 下载示例文档到本地

\begin{center}
\fbox{\href{\fileuri/gerbil.jpg?dl=1}{点此下载例图}}

\fbox{\href{\fileuri/bib-exercise.bib?dl=1}{点此下载bib文档示例}}
\end{center}

\item 上传到Overleaf (打开Project菜单).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{更多技巧}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item 添加 \cmdbs{tableofcontents} 命令，可自动提取 \cmdbs{section} 中的信息并生成目录.

\item 把文档类型 \cmdbs{documentclass} 改为
\mint{latex}!\documentclass{scrartcl}!
或\mint{latex}!\documentclass[12pt]{IEEEtran}!

\item 为复杂的方程自定义命令:
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\newcommand{\rperf}{%
  \rho_{\text{perf}}}
$$
\rperf = {\bf c}'{\bf X} + \varepsilon
$$
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{常用宏包}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \bftt{beamer}: 做幻灯片（就是我）
\item \bftt{todonotes}: 注释和备忘
\item \bftt{tikz}: 制图惊艳
\item \bftt{pgfplots}: \LaTeX 绘图
\item \bftt{listings}: 在 \LaTeX 中显示源码
\item \bftt{spreadtab}: 在 \LaTeX 中制表
\item \bftt{gchords}, \bftt{guitar}: 吉他和弦和图氏记谱
\item \bftt{cwpuzzle}: 填字游戏
\end{itemize}
\url{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples} 和 \url{http://texample.net}
上有以上（大多数）宏包的示例。
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{安装\LaTeX{}}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item 若想在自己电脑上编译 \LaTeX{}，需使用 \LaTeX{}
\emph{distribution}(发布版)。发布版包括一个 \bftt{latex} 编译器及（通常）上千个宏包.
\begin{itemize}
\item Windows操作系统: \href{http://miktex.org/}{Mik\TeX} or \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
\item Linux: \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
\item Mac: \href{http://tug.org/mactex/}{Mac\TeX}
\end{itemize}
\item 需要一个支持\LaTeX{} 的文本编辑器。\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors} 上有不少选择。
\item 需要进一步学习 \bftt{latex} 和有关工具——下一页提供了一些资料。
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{在线资料}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}{The \LaTeX{} Wikibook} ——实用的教程和参考资料。
\item \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/}{\TeX{} Stack Exchange} ——先搜索已解决问题再提问；很快就有优质解答。

% -- latex understands words, sentences and paragraphs

Words are separated by one or more spaces.  Paragraphs are separated by
one or more blank lines.  The output is not affected by adding extra
spaces or extra blank lines to the input file.

Double quotes are typed like this: ``quoted text''.
Single quotes are typed like this: `single-quoted text'.

Emphasized text is typed like this: \emph{this is emphasized}.
Bold       text is typed like this: \textbf{this is bold}.

-- Adding structure to your document

\section{Hello}

\subsection{World}

\subsection{Foo}

\subsubsection*{Stuff} % star form

\subsubsection*{Results}

-- Labels and cross-references

\label{sec:intro}
\label{sec:method}
\ref{sec:method}

--> maybe introduce the prettyref package here.

-- Mathematics

Inline mathematics: $x + y < 7$.

'Displayed' mathematics:
\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
\end{equation*}

\begin{align}
\end{align}

-- Figures

- Need the graphicx package.

- here we can start introducing options

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{}

- where do you find out about these options? --> link to the Wikibook

-- Floating Figures

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{...}
\caption{\label{}Here is a caption.}
\end{figure}

-- Tables

- not the nicest part of LaTeX

\usepackage{tabularx}

\begin{tabular}{llr}
Item & Quantity & Price (\$) & Amount
Widget & 1 &
\end{tabular}

Bonus points: check out the fp package and the spreadtab package.

-- Document Classes

a .cls file

article

some journal templates come with one

-- Bibliographies



-- For Typesetting Geeks

- dashes: -, --, ---

- ellipsis.

- controlling spaces: ~, \ , \,, \@

- spacing after periods (et al., etc.)

- Nested quotation marks: ``\,`

\item Use the \emph{star form} to display an equation without a number.
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{equation*}
F(x) = \int_{a}^{x}{f(t) dt}
\end{equation*}
\end{exampletwouptiny}

\begin{itemize}
\item \bftt{equation} and \bftt{equation*} are called \emph{environments}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \cmdbs{begin} and \cmdbs{end} commands define the environment.
  \item The \cmd{\$} also starts and ends an environment.
  \item Some commands are defined only within certain environments.
  \item Some commands behave differently in different environments.
